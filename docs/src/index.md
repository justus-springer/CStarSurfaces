# CStarSurfaces.jl

A computer algebra package for rational $\mathbb{C}^*$-surfaces in the Julia
programming language. This package makes use of the
[OSCAR](https://www.oscar-system.org) Computer Algebra System.

The approach to $\mathbb{C}^*$-surfaces relies on the general combinatorial
theory of varieties with finitely generated Cox ring developed in
[BeHa07](@cite), [Ha08](@cite) and its
specialization to varieties with torus action initiated in [HaHe13](@cite) and
[HaSu10](@cite). As an
introductory reference, we mention [ArDeHaLa15](@cite).
